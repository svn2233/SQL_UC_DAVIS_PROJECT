# YELP DATASET SQL
This is a SQL project that I did for the course "SQL for Data Science" offered by UC Davis via Coursera. In this project I am tasked as a data scientist to profile and analyze the given Yelp Dataset. In part 1 I answer the project's given questions and provide the SQL code I used to arrive at the  answer. In part 2 of the project I'm asked to come up with my own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question I want to answer.
