# YELP DATASET SQL
This is a SQL project that I did for the course "SQL for Data Science" offered by UC Davis via Coursera. In this project I am tasked as a data scientist to answer the given questions and provide the SQL code to arrive to the answer in part 1 of this project. In part 2 of the project I'm asked to come up with my own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question I want to answer.
